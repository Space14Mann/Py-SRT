### DATA SOURCES:

- Meteorological & Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre, (MOSDAC/SAC/ISRO), https://mosdac.gov.in.
MOSDAC is a data repository for the missions of the Indian Space Research Organisation and Government of India, dealing with meteorology, oceanography and tropical water cycles. Data acquired from missions is disseminated in near real time from Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad through the MOSDAC web site

- North Eastern Space Applications Centre (NESAC), https://nesac.gov.in.
The North Eastern Space Applications Centre (NESAC), a joint initiative of Department of Space (DOS) and the North Eastern Council (NEC) is a society registered under the Meghalaya Societies Registration Act, 1983. The Centre has provided more than 20 years of dedicated service to the eight states of North Eastern Region (NER) of India using space science and technology.

### LIBRARIES/MODULES:

- The Python ARM Radar Toolkit, Py-ART https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart.
The Python ARM Radar Toolkit, Py-ART, is an open source Python module containing a growing collection of weather radar algorithms and utilities build on top of the Scientific Python stack and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license. Py-ART is used by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) User Facility for working with data from a number of precipitation and cloud radars but has been designed so that it can be used by others in the radar and atmospheric communities to examine, processes, and analyze data from many types of weather radars.

- PYSCANCF, https://github.com/syedhamidali/PyScanCf.
PyScanCf is a library for creating cfradial (polar) data from IMD radars that contain all 10 sweeps from single scans which are named as (Polar_ABC.nc) as well as gridded radar data from which are named as (grid_ABC.nc). Both formats are compatible for PyART. It uses Pyart to create grid data, so please remember to cite Py-ART as well.
